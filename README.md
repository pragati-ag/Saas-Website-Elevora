Project Overview:
Elevora is a fully responsive, modern web application designed to help startups organize, collaborate, and track their progress. This project focuses on creating a sleek and user-friendly landing page with interactive features to attract potential users and provide them with the information they need to get started with the platform.

As a Front-End Developer, I was responsible for the design and development of the entire front-end, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Features:
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it provides a seamless user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout for a flexible and adaptive layout.

Interactive Hero Section: The landing page includes a bold hero section that introduces the brand and provides a clear call-to-action for visitors to get started or book a demo.

Pricing Section: Displays clear and concise pricing information, with a free plan and a premium option, including features that come with each plan. The section is designed for easy scanning and understanding.

Testimonial Carousel: Showcases customer success stories with a clean grid layout. These testimonials help build trust and encourage potential users to try the platform.

JavaScript: Utilized for creating interactive elements, such as the hamburger menu and accordion FAQ.
